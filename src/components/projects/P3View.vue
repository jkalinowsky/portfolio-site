      <h3>Description and idea</h3>
      <p>
        To overcome the paywalls in popular quiz or flashcards applications, my friend and I decided
        to create our own platformâ€”one that helps students prepare for their exams without limitations.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project is developed by two students, with me as the product owner. Our goal is to
        provide a free and effective learning tool, since in our opinion, a student-driven initiative
        is the best advantage over university restrictions.
